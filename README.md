# Autosu!
Osu! autoplay bot, made with CefSharp Winforms and native C# libraries, with the dedication to simulate human hand movement.

This is a beginner's project and do not expect good code. Despite application will have full functionality, expect bad practices and non-optimal implementations in source code. You are more than welcome to make suggestions and fork this.

**Logging out and disconnection from Bancho is recommended.** Submitting scores played by Autosu! to Bancho is against osu! rules. This is cheating. Violators' accounts will be restricted.

This software is made with the intent of experimenting human movement simulation with the Osu! game. You are not required to disable/quit any antivirus software before beginning.

Any related developers may not be held liable for any Osu! account restrictions as a result of using this software.

This software is open source. For instructions on usage and installation, see the Wiki.

## Clean Installation
1. Proceed to the "Releases" section of this repository and download a release.
2. Extract the files from the ZIP file, or install the software with the MSI installer, into any directory of your choice.
3. Open Autosu!.exe.
4. You will see the song selection screen. In the bottom there are two boxes, a *Beatmap Selection* box and a *Difficulty Selection*. Both boxes' contents are scrollable if its content overflows. Both boxes should be blank and 0 Beatmaps should be found.
5. Copy the absolute path of your Osu! installation directory (where the osu!.exe file is located), and paste it in the "Osu! Path" input box. Hit enter and beatmap should now load. This setting saves automatically.
6. Click on a beatmap and a difficulty next to it. The wide box below it should now show. Click "Initialize Autosu!" to confirm song selection and proceed to the autopilot screen.
