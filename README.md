**This is a beginner's project.** Do not expect good code. Despite application will have full functionality, expect bad practices and non-optimal implementations in source code. You are more than welcome to make suggestions and fork this. The UI is Boeing-737 cockpit styled, as I've been obsessed with aviation simulation lately.

**Autosu! does not read or write memory.** Autosu! operates purely on reading the beatmap (.osu) files. However, this means Autosu! cannot automatically detect the start of a song and cannot automatically read the current progress of a song. Manual calibration is required.

**Logging out and disconnection from Bancho is recommended.** Submitting scores played by Autosu! to Bancho is against osu! rules. This is cheating. Violators' accounts will be restricted.

This software is made with the intent of experimenting human movement simulation with the Osu! game. You are not required to disable/quit any antivirus software before beginning.

Any related developers may not be held liable for any Osu! account restrictions as a result of using this software.

This software is open source. For instructions on usage and installation, see the Wiki.
